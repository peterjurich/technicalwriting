## Introduction

If you’re reading this, that means you have agreed to watch our dogs for a bit. So first of all: THANK YOU! Your help really means the world to us. And we’re sure you’ll find that watching our two little pups will be a walk in the park.

Toby and Ollie are both super sweet and love new people, but they also have pretty different personalities. So let’s get introductions out of the way, shall we?

## Toby
Let’s start with Toby, since he’s older. He is the tan one with curly hair. He’s a 5-year-old Norfolk terrier mix who loves cheese, routines, and quiet time alone. We call him “our little narc” because he is such a rule-follower. You know that kid in middle school who reminded the teacher that the class was supposed to have a quiz that day? That’s Toby in a nutshell. He is a very particular boy, as you will no doubt see by how long it takes him to prep a pile of blankets for a nap. (Spoiler: it’s about 10 minutes.)

 TOBY. IS. A. GROMP. Oh my Lord is this dog grumpy. When he has a plan and something messes with it, he will let you know by booping you gently with his snoot. But more often than not, the thing bothering him is his brother Ollie. If this happens, he will growl a few times, but eventually give up as Ollie can be pretty persistent. Speaking of which…


## Ollie

Oh Ollie. Our special special boy. Ollie is the sleek black one who likely has something stuck to his nose. Ollie is 4 years old and some kind of schipperke mix (which means “little boatman” in an old Dutch language). He is the proverbial big dog in a little dog’s body. He’s playful, rambunctious, and absolutely cannot take a hint when you’re done petting him. (And watch out for his little wet tongue!) He loves just about any food, playing tug with his toys, and sitting on Toby (which is the #1 cause of Toby’s growling.)

Ollie is… Well, he’s not the brightest knife in the shed, but he has a heart of gold. Despite the rest of his nature, he is oddly afraid of just about anything and will put as much distance as possible between himself and any new objects.

## Going Outside
The first thing they need to do in the morning, right after you get home, and the last thing at night is go outside. When you are home, you’re welcome to leave the small dog door open for them to go in or out as they please. (Just be sure to close it when you leave, but more on that later.)

If they start barking at neighbors or people walking by, it will pass pretty quickly, but if it does not, you’re welcome to call them inside and shut the door for a few minutes until they calm down.

## Walks

Walks are totally optional. They are pretty able to get all their exercise out in the backyard, but just in case you feel like it…

The list of things Toby loves more than a walk is extremely short. (It’s Emily. That’s the list.)  Because he gets so incredibly excited at the mere mention of a walk, we actually don’t even say the word around him unless we are absolutely going to go within the next 5 minutes. We instead opt for “W-A-L-K” in casual conversation.

Ollie, on the other hand, would rather do literally anything else, but will participate begrudgingly.

You’ll find their leash hanging on the coat rack next to the front door.

This video explains how to clip them in, as well as some general tips for success:

There are black poop bags in the white canvass bag by the front door. But if you’re all out, there’s a bag station at the end of the block on the other side of the parking lot.

Ollie can be reactive and aggressive toward other dogs when he is in his harness. When we go on walks, we tend to avoid other dogs and cross the street if we see any coming. His fur will stand on end and he will growl a bit, but that’s all.

Toby pulls on the leash more than is comfortable, but only because he insists on exploring so much. He will also poop upwards of 4 times on the walk, so either bring several bags, or bring one and don’t throw it out until the walk is over.

## Leaving the House
The dogs can be left alone for up to eight hours, so you should be good to go to work, run errands, hang out with friends, whatever.

Our only requirements is that, before you leave, please:
* Make sure the backdoor (including the small dog door) is closed
* The couch is covered
* The dogs have toys out to play with
* The front door is locked and closed properly

Need a video reference? Here’s one for you!

## Dinner

The dogs eat once a day - usually around 4:00 p.m. If you open the door to the basement (the one between the kitchen and the living room) and look down, you’ll see two clear circular containers full of dog food. One of  them has a measuring cup in it.

To feed the dogs:
1. Fill Toby’s green ceramic bowl with one full cup of food.
2. Fill Ollie’s silver aluminum bowl with ~¾ cup.

### BONUS:
On the stairs, you’ll also find a smaller round container labeled Coprophagia. If you think of it, hide half a pill in each of their meals. This will prevent Ollie from eating dog poop in the backyard.

## Bedtime
If you remember, put their water bowl on the counter an hour before you go to bed. This is because Toby likes to take a biiiiiiiiiiig drink of water after his last pee of the day. And if this happens, he might wake you up in the middle of the night needing to go out.

How does he do that? Well, he’ll get up from his bed, walk to the bottom of the stairs and he’ll cry. And cry. And when crying doesn’t wake you up, he’ll begin making grumpy old man sounds. You’ll know what we mean when you hear them.

If this does happen, simply go into the kitchen with him, open the dog door and let him out. Then wait for him to come back in, close the dog door, and head back upstairs.

Otherwise, their bedtime routine is pretty easy. Here is a video that explains the whole thing.

## Health & Safety
Toby and Ollie’s veterinarian is Healthy Pet Vet Clinic at 2801 E Washington Ave. It is literally right around the corner. Their phone number is (608) 294-9494.

We’ve never had to take these dogs to an emergency vet clinic, but in case there’s an emergency in the middle of the night, the closest is VCA Veterinary Emergency Services at 4902 E Broadway. Their phone number is (608) 222-2455.

Ollie sometimes makes a sound like he is struggling for air. He does this when he is over excited. It is incredibly jarring the first time you hear it, so I recommend watching this video of it first so you’re not alarmed if he does it around you.

His vet is unconcerned by this and says it is only an emergency if you see his skin turning blue (which you can see by parting the hair around his face. If he starts doing it and it seems to be sustained, lasting for longer than a few minutes, we always do three things:
1. Take off his collar
2. Give him access to ample water
3. Make sure he has space to relax, whether that is in his crate or on the couch, with plenty of pets on the head

And finally, if you need a list of foods that are OK or not OK for them to eat, check out the refrigerator. There is a list in the upper lefthand corner of the bottom door.
Thank you
Once again, thank you so much for watching our little goobers. We really appreciate your help. If you feel compelled to send us photos of you and the dogs while we’re gone, we would obviously welcome that.

Happy puppy sitting!
