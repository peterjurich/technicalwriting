# Module 1: What is AI?
## Machine learning
a type of AI that learns A to B, or input to output mappings: this is called supervised learning
If you want the best possible levels of performance, then you need two things
1. it really helps to have a lot of data. So that's why sometimes you hear about big data. Having more data almost always helps.
2. you want to be able to train a very large neural network.

## What is data?
### How do you acquire data?
1. Manual labeling
2. get a dataset is from observing user behaviors or other types of behaviors
3. download it from a website or to get it from a partner

Tip 1: once you've started collecting some data, go ahead and start showing it or feeding it to an AI team
Tip 2: don't throw data in an AI team and assume it will be valuable
Tip 3: if you have bad data, then the AI will learn inaccurate things

### Structured vs unsctructured data
Structured lives in a spreadsheet
Unstructured is images, audio, and text. These are types of data that humans find it very easy to interpret

## Terminology
### Machine learning
the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
it's a piece of software that any time of day, any time of night, you can automatically input A, these properties of house, and output B.

### Data science
the science of extracting knowledge and insights from data.
output of a data science project is often a slide deck, the PowerPoint presentation that summarizes conclusions for executives to take business actions or that summarizes conclusions for a product team to decide how to improve a website

### Neural Network
A neuron is the space between A (price) and B (demand)that calculates the relationship
More complexity would include shipping cost, marketing, material all interacting and lead to a fourth neuron that calculates demand
One of the great things about neural networks is you just need to give it A and B and it figures everything else out.

#### Neural networks and face recognition
Computers see a table of numbers each indicating brightness of the pixel for B&W pgoto, adds RGB values for color.
First neurons detect edges, 2nd detect shapes, 3rd faces. Your job is to input lots of data. The network will figure it out.

### Neural network or deep learning?
a very effective technique for learning A to B or input-output mappings.
Today, the terms neural network and deep learning are used almost interchangeably, they mean essentially the same thing.

## What make an AI company?

A lesson from rise of the Internet:
Shopping mall + website =/= Internet company
Intenternet company engages in:
* A/B testing
* Short iteration times
* Decision making pushed down to engineers and other specialized roles

Similarly: Company + deep learning =/= AI company
AI companies:
* Strategic data acquisition
* Unified data warehouses
* Pervasive automation
* New roles and division of labor

### How to become good at AI:
5-step AI Transformation Playbook:
1. Execute pilot projects to gain momentum
2. Build an in-house AI team
3. Provide broad AI training
4. Develop an AI strategy
5. Develop internal and external comms

## What machine learning can and cannot do
Media tends to overhype AI capabilities leading to unrealistic expectations
ML works well when:
Learning a "simple" concept
Lots of data available

Works poorly when:
Learning complex tasks from small amount of data
perform on new types of data that's different than the data it has seen in your data set

### Can do
Imperfect rule of thumb: anything you can do w/a second of thought, AI can do
Route proper email requests to dept.
Take a picture of what's in front of car and determine where other cars are.
Diagnose pneumonia from 10,000 labelled image

### Cannot do
Analyze a market and wrote a 50-page report
Write an empathetic response to a complex request
Look at a picture and determine intention
Diagnose pneumonia from 10 images of pneumonia and some explanatory text

# Module 2: Building AI Projects
## Workflow of a ML project
Key steps of a a voice recognition project
1. Collect data: Record lot of people saying "Hello"
2. Train model: use ML algo to learn input A (audio clip) to output B (system recognizes)
3. Deploy model: put model into small speaker and ship to small group of test users
You also get more data in this step

## Workflow of a data science project
Output of these is an actionable way to do something differently
Steps:
1. Collect data: dataset that collects when users go to a webpage
2. Analyze data: time of day matters. Interate many times to get good insights
3. Suggest hypotheses/actions
Deploy changes and reanalyze new data periodically

## Every job function needs to learn how to use data
