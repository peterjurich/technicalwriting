**Tools to know: SnagIt, Tango, ClickUp, Loom, Screencastify**

Main bottleneck is communication. Documentation outlines for good TW's include:
* Vision
* Planning
* Execution

TW not just about writing.
For ex.: Typical workflow is:
1. PM freezes requirements
2. UX team devs mockups
3. Devs deliver code for mockups
4. Testers test for bugs
5. TWs deliver docs for feature
6. Internal release
7. goes to market

How is TW is engaged at every step:
1. Works on a timeline from release date working backwards; PM walks TW through user story
2. TW write user interface streams that are simple, intuitive, and effective.
3. Provides any texts like error, prompts, etc. that users will see.
4.TW tests feature as an end user. TW becomes first customer, which aids in docu.
5. By now, TW should have 75% of knowledge to work on docu, which is shared with stakeholders.
Actual docu is 35-40%, but 60-65% for everything else.

TWs and Product Managers are very similar: conductv similar research, articulate big picture goals, priorities, 
TWs bridge real world problems w/optimal solutions and bring something new into existence
TW is audience champion, a point of clarity, team players, editors, excellent researchers
Junior TW>Intermediate>Senior>Documentation Manager (planning, organizing, leading, coordinating, budget)
Product Managers make $$$$ and skills transfer well
UX Design is another option

Silence from PM implies consent for signing off on docs. Make it easy for PM to sign
Docu makes visions tangible
**Core part of TW job is to ensure every team member has ongoing access to info about product they’re building**: style guides, customer interviews, etc.
This keeps whole team accountable, sets standards of PRD (Product Requirements Doc)
Mitigates confusion of priorities

CHALLENGES
Tight deadlines, documentation always comes last (must work with devs through pressure and deal w/changes right before release), uncertain hours, constant change, TWs don’t get a lot of respect. Don’t look at doc having impact today, but two years down the road

USER STORY: Software from users perspective, but lacks context/articulation. Maybe there are better ways to meet Z (below)
**TWs can clean up PM’s docs to gain credibility; can use learning objectives to enhance user stories**
Outline: As x person, I want to y so that z happens
JOB STORY: more detailed and context oriented version of user story, tracks a situation someone is in, their motivation to do Y, and what they expect to see/get done

KNOWLEDGE BASE
A library of of docs about your product. A good KB can scale out customer services. FAQs, etc. Custies prefer to find answers on their own (90%)
Reactive customer service is time-consuming. KBs are proactive
Happy custies turn into product advocates
**When interviewing clients, always ask for things to add to KB.**
KB can be both ext/internal
Discoverability is important: sifting most popular articles to home page. Use Google Analytics to measure impact, not tickets

FAQs
Good way to organize answers under a collapsible block of text. Group questions under headings. Give readers opportunity to weigh in
Found on pricing pages

RELEASE NOTES
Tech docs distributed that contain bug fixes and added features. Keeps readers informed and feeling heard.
Keep em brief. Avoid tech jargon, use plain language. Link to FAQs re: added features. Don’t be afraid to sound excited!
Lets users know their feedback was heard. Don't be afraid to sound excited about new features
Can be released in blog, social media, in-app messaging

INSTRUCTION PRODUCT MANUALS:
Diff fr user  bc it focuses on how-to task. User guide has that but also non-task questions
Contains lots of graphics and illustr.
Will include: title, copyright, cover page, purpose, audience analysis
Important q’s:
1. What is products intended use?
2. What are names of important parts?
3. How product delivered to end user?
4. How to transport/store product?
5. How to install/mount?
6. How do I commission product/make it ready for use?
7. How do I use the product?
8. How do I change the settings?
9. How do I maintain/repair?
10. Possible errors and how to solve them?
11. How to dismantle/dispose of?
12. Spare parts available?
13. Technical specs?
14. Any risks to losing data?

SOME SPECIFIC QS:

15. How do I change pricing to annual?
16. How to upload MP4?
17. What does X mean?

USER GUIDES
An easy reference guide not just for users, but for support team, too. Reduces calls if custos can use website first
Best practice is to test guides on actual users
TOC is important
“See Also” lists are also frequently used for anyone looking for a mention of a certain feature
**Add search functionality**

PROPOSALS
A way to pitch an idea and state requirement. Gives chance to make an argument for what you’re thinking
Shows audience you care about cause
Outlining: intro; issue; solution; qualifications; conclusion of costs/benefits
List what you’re solving (like process improvement, cost reduction, new product strategy)
Should include specific metrics (used as KPIs), a definitions of those metrics and prose and cons
Ex. financial models and grants, process of applying for funding

SCIENCE WRITING
I KNOW ALL THIS!

MEDICAL WRITING
Prepping medical education materials (leaflets, posters)

WHITE PAPERS
An in depth report/guide around a topic and the problems around it. Info is backed by reliable data/resources
Charts, graphs, tables
Tips: professional tone, narrowly focused, fact-based, data-backed
Industry research reports from Forrester or Gartner can be a good starting point.
Or Google search for INDUSTRY + RESEARCH FIRM
Ex. government research: U.S. Small Business Admin, American Fact Finder, Bureau of Labor Stats

CASE STUDIES
Corporate CS: What did co do to be what it is today?
Comparative CS: How does one co compare to others in same industry?
Issue CS: How did co solve x problem?
First ask these questions of custos:
* Surprise results: a non-traditional cust saw overly positive results
* Recognizable name: bigger brands increase credibility
* Competitive win: won more business than another co and how you did that
* If looking to expand in industry, need a case for meeting challenges in industry
* Willingness to participate
OUTLINE
* Tease results with highlight
* Custo’s business overview: build understanding of current challenges/goals
* Challenges: match customers need with your products/services
* Decision-making process: show process of how custo decided to work with you and guide decision making for potential custos
* Solution: help potential custo see how product is currently being used
* Results: impressive, measurable insight with call to action
DO NOT SKIP DESIGN

API WRITING
API, or Application Programming Interface, allows devs to transmit data btw software products easily. With API, you can fetch features of a product and integrate them into your application.
Ex. Using chat feature
API docs are key to dev experience and docu is imperative bc devs are unlikely to keep using a product w/poor docu
Why API? AI docu is important for dev experience. Happy devs = popular API, which can only be as good as its docu. With good docu, your team is less likely to spend time onboarding new users or responding to support calls/emails.
Pivotal sections in any API doc: Overview (detail onboarding and API attributes, a quick win will grab attention); Authentication (how to get access credentials, this is a big hurdle); Resources (users will interact more with this than any other section); Error messages (Include all potential errors and how to solve them); and terms of use (legal agreement for how users will ideally use your product).
IMPORTANT: Be consistent with universally accepted naming conventions and terminologies.
Devs like when they can test what they read in the docs and see how it works. INCLUDE INTERACTIVE SAMPLE CODES IN POPULAR PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES

PRODUCT ROADMAPPING -b a guide for steps you need to take to reach a co’s product short and long term goals with different confidence levels
TWs are rarely asked to make one
Kinds of roadmaps:
* Evolutionary roadmap – keeps everyone in sync when final product is unclear
* Release roadmap – tool for customer community to keep them informed
* Theme roadmap – logical way to comm next features needed to meet goals and custo’s needs. Indicates where product is going and how it will get there
* Timeboxed roadmap – like release, but more detailed. Serves as reminder that work should be completed by a certauin date
* Capacity roadmap – like release, but for specific depts. Used as comms tool to show what products are expected. Used to discuss resources needed
* Market Requirements roadmap – helps co steer marketing and positioning
* Opportunity roadmap – used for cos that sell to businesses
* Project Roadmap – used to align teams working on diff projects. Lets them see how their work fits with whole vision
First step: defining a project strategy
Second step: gather info from two main sources: custo support team; and product users
Good roadmap is a strong foundation, but should be flexible.
No perfect confidence levels, move ideas forward, set north star metrics –the metrics that determine the success of your initiatives – and also counter-metrics (Google these)
In development, there are many alternatives at all times. A roadmap mandates you to choose one.
Roadmaps are subject to change based on new info (agile)
Roadmaps align stakeholders w/direction it’s headed.
TWs can provide depth to a roadmap
A simple structure is to ensure each row includes the following columns
* New product feature idea
* User story and requirements
* Effort required (work with team to define effort)
* Sequence
* Est. release date

COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS (Used to increase salary and work on proposals)
To determine strengths/weaknesses of competitors, strategies that provide advantage, barriers preventing competition, and exploitative weaknesses. Doing this helps you determine your co’s uniqueness and value and discover 
Are you feature competitive? Is your pricing?
Core questions to ask:
* Are other co’s doing what we do?
* Are potential custos getting a product at their preferred level?
Research direct (offers more less less the same good/services in the same market) and indirect competitors (offer a diff product that serves the same need)
Reseaerch skill is high up for TWs
Begin by identifying who/what co’s up against, then gather key info 
A market analysis confirms customer needs, industry changes, and fiscal opportunities
On market:
* Who is your ideal customer?
* What is the size of the market of ideal customers?
* How has market changed in recent years? Where headed?
On vision (from websites):
* Why do these products exist?
* Which problems do they solve?
* Any problems they don’t solve?
Positioning (where competitors see themselves in market)
* How do comps market products?
* What language do they use?
* Which core problems do they solve?
Personas (can be found in docs)
* What are job titles of comp’s typical custos?
* What industry do target custos work in?
* What are target custo skills/interests?
* How do their personas differ from yours?
Differentiators
* Product key benefits?
* Is look and feel superior to mine?
* Price lower or higher?
* Does product work better than the rest?
* Superior custo service?
Strengths and drives
* Sign up for free trial of product
* What do they excel at?
* What do they do better?
* What unique insights do founders offer?
Weaknesses
* What do their users struggle with?
* What aspects are lacking?
* What custo needs are not being met?

MARKET REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT
A tech doc that expresses custo’s needs/wants for product and overall market opportunity
Usually explains: target audience, competition, why custos want product
MRD defines what custos need and how product will provide. PRD describes how itr should be built. MRD informs PRD
Usually a product manager job, but will collab w/TWs
MRD is used to give overview of what is required to succeed
Waterfall approach: all docs up front. MRD will help here
Agile PM’s usually write a short version
This doc should articulate the opportunity you are pursuing.
Seven things to address in an MRD:
1. Executive summary: what problem are you trying to solve?
2. Vision: what makes product/service unique?
3. Target market: How big is the opportunity or rmarket size?
4. Personas: who are you solving problem for?
5. Competitor analysis: what alternatives exist?
7. High level capabilities: What functionality must be included to solve customer needs?
7. Metric strategy: How will you measure success

PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DOC (PRD)
A doc used to communicate what capabilities must be included in a product release
Typically used more in waterfall projects
Should include vision, product goals/initiatives and features, details about how end user will interact with features
Does not need to be lengthy
Should contain:
* Objectives
    * Vision, goals, strategic product initiatives, personas
* Release
    * Release name, date, initiative, features in release, milestones, dependencies
* Features (where explain what should be built)
    * User story, description, purpose, use problem, user value (how helps), Assumptions, What we’re not doing, Acceptance criteria
    * Picture of what you envision via wireframe; helps improve exp and reduce misunderstandings
* Analytics (how to measure success)
    * “We believe <this feature> will achieve <this outcome>”
* Performance indicators (understanding custo behavior to build best product, KPIs)
    * Exs. % of users interacting w/features, how long the first time takes, often often used, how long they spend w/each feature, how they navigate through workflows, abandonment rate
    * Goal is to capture KPIs for each feature: baseline, target, timeframe,

OBJECTIVES & KEY RESULTS (OKRs)
Plan what you will achieve alongside how you measure success. Scale of 0-1.0, with 0.7-1.0 indicating success. A collab tool to measure goals
Set them by portfolio (Microsoft products for , product
Shared priorities = time resource investment, smaller units of work = larger success
Best TWs use a goal-first approach to OKRs
OKRs give you a framework to pair objectives with the key results; Example: Connect building new product goal to business goal of increased revenue
Other examples: add x custos per month; reduce user churn to < x% /mon, inc avg subscription to $x/mo

PROTOTYPING
An early sample.model release, etc. created to test a product or process. Used to improve design and test accuracy of analysts.
May be closest to problem/solution bridge.
Prototyping software: Figma, InVision, Balsamiq
**Low-Fidelity** Pr: trying to simply understand user needs; spending time on specifics too early could be wasted time
**Mid-Fidelity Pr**: as understanding of needs improves, cvan think about how final solution will work and do user testing. Can design digital prs that users can click through
API writing and making integrations tangible
**High-Fidelity Pr**: validate solution. Created once have deep understanding of problem
TIPS: Avoid getting emotionally attached, get user input, 

USER JOURNEY MAPS
A diagram that shows flow from initial contact or discovery, through engagement, to long term loyalty/advocacy
Goals: identifies ways to get custos engaged from beginning; uncover pitfall that turn them away; inc # of custos
How to use: add insights to roadmap; add weights to insights to better prioritize; score costs/benefits of each step; move top items to roadmap
New learnings: FAQs? Subscribe now button?

MEETING NOTES (ClickUp is a good tool)
Allow productivew time/reflection/momentum
Should include: name of group, topic, kind of mtg; # ppl there; names present/absent; full desc of resolutions; which resos were rejected; record of votes for/against something; all main motions and who supported, etc

OTHER DOCU
Memo: mass comming policy
Report: describes process, progress of science problem, recommendation, summary of research
Tutorial: transfers knowledge
Product Description: describes for custos/users; problems end point for them to work back from

**AGILE**
Values: individuals/interactions over processes, working software over docu, custo collab or contracts, responding to change over a plan
MANIFESTO: More useful to have a working product than detailed engineering specifications (which delay start of dev and inhibit design)
Having some engineering specs in doc form help UX, QA, Marketing,Sales, Support, but should be devved frequently
**A scrum team MUST consider custo docu as a part of “working software”**
Planning w/o need to have plans before work begins
**If you write first words after dev, you are not agile**

SCRUM
TWs spend a lot of time trying to integrate w/scrum. This integration works well when you have docu to develop that’s tied to a specific discreet feature.
2 popular approaches to docu in Agile:
Writers participate directly in Scrum teams
Estab docu function as a peer to eng, ux, and qa; demonstrate value w/each product; advocate for customer; review error messages quickly as items are devved and coded, saving custo support lots of time in the future; act as point of contact for SMEs;
BUT: can lead to silos and inability to share writing resources; hard to substitute if someone needs to be out
A separate scrum team of writers who docu work of dev teams as work is finalized
Setting up separate team allows for writer sprints; invest less time in tracking ongoing features – feature is likely to be close to final version; good for cross training;
Biggest hurdle is being involved late in the cycle. Lack of writer participation in dev cycle can lead to inconsistency.
Violates most of Agile manifesto and becomes a waterfall approach

HOW OPEN SHOULD COLLAB BE?
Open collab encourages int users to participate, report processes and share ownership as well as provide feedback mechanisms
But employees can also enter incorrect/redundant info; monitor edits closely
Editing doc like code is an approach: writers and devs work in same repositories; community edits open source projects

RESEARCH VS WRITING
Info dev cycle is continuos; writing is only a small part
Areas of shared knowledge: audience analysis; use testing/feedback; delivery format
Identifying audience helps you focus on writing that is scoped and detailed
Do details match user exp level? 
How can we org content on website? How do topics relate? Do they need links to relevant topics?
Feedback: a company w/a feedback plan has a better chance of succeeding. Product, docu, eng, ux and edu teams should all meet to address common problems
**The more you understand the user journey, the more you understand the product you’re offering.**

INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE
IA is how info is structured on website or app. A visual representation of features, interactions, and hierarchy. Answers where can I get info fast and easily. Good IA is esssential for ranking on Google.
Connects three elements:
* user
    * Focus on who your mapping out for bc ppl look for info in diff ways and diff kinds of info (mental models will help)
* content
    * the information itself 
* context
    * The place for the information
Cognitive load: How can we make sure users are not overwhelmed and info remains relevant? Use filters, sorting options, save information, compare info tables
Content audits looks at all info on website and map the structure.
Visual hierarchy makes it easier for users to scan a webpage or to see elements or pieces of info in relation to each
Good IA also takes into account emotional part of user journey.

HOW TO CREATE IA
A single doc that has simple and understandable rep of how app or website works is vital for developing new features, updating old ones, or seeing what is possible moving forward.
Where used? Knowledge bases,linking docu, making docu easier for users to find.
Follows similar patterns to flow charts.
Two major requirements:
1. Organizing in visual hierarchy
2. Creating a legend to display every engagement point uniquely
The most important factors to building IA are where individ componants of arch are placed
CONSTRUCTING IA Each piece needs individ research an dev
Sitemaps orgs pages numerically
Card-sorting: items on cards and moved into categories
Tree-testing: reverse card-sorting where users find things in tree
**TOOLS FOR IA
* draw.io (free)
* Lucidchart**
BEST PRACTICES
Focus on structure, not hierarchy
All processes need logic
Remember UX
Remember you're a map maker: TWs decide what goes into IA design
IA changes based on user needs
The better team knows IA, the more they can explore what's possible.
    
COMMON WRITING PROBLEMS
Poor design; lack of accessibility; not mobile optimized; poor maintenance; inconsistencies; mistargeting; no feedback channels; lack of structure & collab; stagnation
Don’t make your audience think. **If they’re thinking, you’ve already lost them.** The more they think, the less clarity you’ve given. **Does it make them think or take action?**

AUDIENCE ANALYSIS
If you get this right, more likely to get lightbulb moment for readers
Understand who stakeholders are:
Who is the audience, their goals, background, needs/interests, demographic characteristics, cultural/communication preferences
Suggest spreadsheet to keep track
Audience question framework: Who are they? What do they need? Where/when/why/how reading?
How did you get knowledge? Document sources: surveys/questionaires; popular opinions/stereotypes; personal exp; brainstorming; audience feedback; other depts; data analysis; google
Take this info and create specific persona based on analysis. Give it a name and write docu to cater to it.
Example persona:
**Persona and audience are not the same**: similar to user story and job story
A persona should align to an audience definition. A persona is a specific instance of someone who belongs to an audience type. Should tell you how an ind person will interact w/your product. Will guide feature dev. A useful audience definition works better than persona for training new PMs and TWs. 
How form an audience definition? Team possess that turns intuition into actionable steps. Balance btw generic and focused. Short-term team of user advocates and set up meetings. Discussion can start w/assumptions and identifying non-represented audiences. At the end, should have a set of definitions with details on each (sub) category.
Tips: Apply approximation methods; may never create a 100% appropriate docu; TWs may not have good access to end users and custos, so important to work w/int ppl w/access.

AUDIENCE ANALYSIS LEARNING CURVE
Defines how much effort should go into docu bc at some point, marginal changes hurt
Who: 
* end users (want info immediately and w/zero interferance
    * Novice: know nothing about product, but know about their business; must always provide docu for novice; need short, simple quickstart guides; not interested in references, want to jump straight into function
    * Expert: wants to know how to do MORE; has used product for long time, but reaches an error; wants searchable, context-sensitive help; will rely on release notes
* Installers
    * Useful to find internal person(qa, eng, ops)  to act as installer for your docu
    * Should include install guides, quick-reference steps, upgrade instructions, config material, quickstart install cards/posters
* operations people (manage data center)
    * IT to data center
    * Job is to keep company running day-to-day
    * Need to know how to keep hardware from going down
        * Op guides, networking guides, troubleshooting, reference docs, system admin
* devs (use APIs to customize your software for client businesses)
    * Eng, design, build tech
    * Dev for int/custos: design docs, use cases, tech requirement docs,
* trainers (teach cos how to use product)
    * Goal: to learn enough about trainer to teach trainees
    * Great testers for docs and distribute docs
* Custo support reps
* Steps for determining what to write
    * Purpose for reading
    * What aud needs to know
    * What they already know
    * If they need proof
* **The audience doesn’t need to know everything you need to know.**

SMEs
Anyone from inventor to guy in mail room. Depends on topic

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
Intended goal or outcome; provide director for content and also users
Three types:
* Awareness: User should be able to identify, summarize, describe a concept or feature
* Comprehension: user should be able to understand how feature applies to their use case
* Applicable skill: user should be able to follow instructions to complete a task
Learning objectives are NOT the same as user goals
User goals: pragmatic, real-world solutions to real problem
Learning objective: identifies skills a user needs to achieve user goals
Ex. “The user should be able to follow/repeat/identify/describe/choose…”
Bennies: **Having one defined objective helps you create modular content that reduces the chance of overlap with other docu.**
Easier to: research, create, organize
User goals: pragmatic, real-world solutions to real problems
Benefits of: Having one overriding goal reduces the chance of repeated docu
docu is easier to create, organize, maintain, and use.
A learning objecttive's exit criteria should indicate where the reader should be by the time they finish reading. It is like a marker on a map.
Knowing the starting point means knowing your audience. Identify pre-reqs.
USE A L.O. MATRIX
1. Begin by marking a plot on the matrix. Imagine where you want the user to be
2. Write the L.O.
3. Adjust plotting.
4. Repeat.
5. Share and discuss.
Ask "Is this something the learner will actually do in the real world?"
   
Refining an objective: may need to break one objective into several more. They should be action oriented.

Does it support user go
