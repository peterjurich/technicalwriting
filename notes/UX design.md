# Intro to UX Design

Users= ppl who interact w/products to meet a goal

Curse of knowledge; instead, be empathetic

## What is UX?
Actively building exp around users and needs
Should reduce frustration by designing exp for things users already know
underlying process and how it works
study users, protype
ask "how can we make thi easier for users?
planner
has a role in a team env
research based, not speculation
should be circular and iterative

### UX process
1. Research
2. Choose direction
3. Build personas
4. Build empathy maps - to better see where they are coming from
5. Determine user goals 
6. Create a user flow - help guide prod dev for navigation
7. Pass to wireframe
8. Test and repeat

## What is UI (user interface)
focus on layout, is aesthetically pleasing while mtg needs
a good interface cannot save a bad ux
visualize

# Creating User Experiences

## User persona
rep profiles of most common type of user
Individual users behave differently
Assess realistically - the main ppl using your product
Why are they using it?
What are their limitations?

### How to create them?
Docs in course notes will help!
Demographic: cannot control
Psychographic: can control; interests
Name, job, location, age, marital status, gender, needs, character traits, habits, goals

## Empathy maps
a tool for ux designers consider how audience uses app based on circumstances
What are they expecting?
Which competitors will users use?
Think & Feel?
Hear?
See?
Say & Do?
Pains?
Gains?

# Determining Goals for your Product
up to ux designer to help meet needs
must talk to anticipated potential users early and often
why wouldthey buy or use product?
Every choice should support helping user reach goals
Can have multiple goals: give drives jobs, get ppl home safely, want app to be popular

## Combining your goals w/user goals
What do they have in common?
Should be win/win for company/user
Venn diagrams help
Can make qualitative goals quantitative by making goals based on fact, data, and measurable outcomes
Think money, engagement, downloads, etc. KPIs
Look at Google Analytics to see how users interact w/you
"Do table reservations improve when you update site?"

## Planning the user journey
### User flow
the route we want users to take from one part of the product to another
should be as efficient as possible "in as few clicks as possible"
The easier it is to book, the less likely to use a competitor
There are specific steps they should taje to reach goals, so steps should be logical
Not every user flow is the same.
We need to guide users w/butoons, feedback, notifications, etc.

### Steps
Make stack of cards w/each page he needs to use. Then decide whether it works for app.
Need destination, pick up location, survey, is there premium option, number of seats, onboarding,etc.
Bonus chalenge: steps needed to create an account
Cord sorting exercise: arrange until make the most sense.
For businessman:
1. Onboarding
2. Pickup location
3. Destination
4. Book (now or later)
5. Schedule (if later)
6. Arrival
7. Vehicle
8. Estimate
9. Price
10. Payment
11. Time
12. Proximity
13. Charge
14. Rate
15. Tip

## Contrasting user goals
Sarah has additional passengers, so her options are limited.
She also doesn't need to schedule rides in advance
Make a new card game, but adding new ones for each extra step
My third persona, will really just want the last 5 steps after doing the whole thing once

# Making a user flow
A diagram w/arrows to show where users go
Showingh flows separate lets you focus, coming helps you compare
Style doesn't matter as much as content

# UX Design Patterns

## What are design patterns?
Visual strategies for solving common usability problems
Keeps cognitive load (the mental effort involved in decision making) to a minimum
Making your design too new and users won't understand
Users spend most of their time on other sites, so yours should work similarly
(Stop signs in other countries, for example)
Not intended to create identical experiences
Provide common language of familiar terms

## Psychology of design patterns
