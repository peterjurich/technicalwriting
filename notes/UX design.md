# Intro to UX Design

Users= ppl who interact w/products to meet a goal

Curse of knowledge; instead, be empathetic

## What is UX?
Actively building exp around users and needs
Should reduce frustration by designing exp for things users already know
underlying process and how it works
study users, protype
ask "how can we make thi easier for users?
planner
has a role in a team env
research based, not speculation
should be circular and iterative

### UX process
1. Research
2. Choose direction
3. Build personas
4. Build empathy maps - to better see where they are coming from
5. Determine user goals 
6. Create a user flow - help guide prod dev for navigation
7. Pass to wireframe
8. Test and repeat

## What is UI (user interface)
focus on layout, is aesthetically pleasing while mtg needs
a good interface cannot save a bad ux
visualize

# Creating User Experiences

## User persona
rep profiles of most common type of user
Individual users behave differently
Assess realistically - the main ppl using your product
Why are they using it?
What are their limitations?

### How to create them?
Docs in course notes will help!
Demographic: cannot control
Psychographic: can control; interests
Name, job, location, age, marital status, gender, needs, character traits, habits, goals

## Empathy maps
a tool for ux designers consider how audience uses app based on circumstances
What are they expecting?
Which competitors will users use?
Think & Feel?
Hear?
See?
Say & Do?
Pains?
Gains?

# Determining Goals for your Product
up to ux designer to help meet needs
must talk to anticipated potential users early and often
why wouldthey buy or use product?
Every choice should support helping user reach goals
Can have multiple goals: give drives jobs, get ppl home safely, want app to be popular

## Combining your goals w/user goals
What do they have in common?
Should be win/win for company/user
Venn diagrams help
Can make qualitative goals quantitative by making goals based on fact, data, and measurable outcomes
Think money, engagement, downloads, etc. KPIs
Look at Google Analytics to see how users interact w/you
"Do table reservations improve when you update site?"

## Planning the user journey
### User flow
the route we want users to take from one part of the product to another
should be as efficient as possible "in as few clicks as possible"
The easier it is to book, the less likely to use a competitor
There are specific steps they should taje to reach goals, so steps should be logical
Not every user flow is the same.
We need to guide users w/butoons, feedback, notifications, etc.

### Steps
Make stack of cards w/each page he needs to use. Then decide whether it works for app.
Need destination, pick up location, survey, is there premium option, number of seats, onboarding,etc.
Bonus chalenge: steps needed to create an account
Cord sorting exercise: arrange until make the most sense.
For businessman:
1. Onboarding
2. Pickup location
3. Destination
4. Book (now or later)
5. Schedule (if later)
6. Arrival
7. Vehicle
8. Estimate
9. Price
10. Payment
11. Time
12. Proximity
13. Charge
14. Rate
15. Tip

## Contrasting user goals
Sarah has additional passengers, so her options are limited.
She also doesn't need to schedule rides in advance
Make a new card game, but adding new ones for each extra step
My third persona, will really just want the last 5 steps after doing the whole thing once

# Making a user flow
A diagram w/arrows to show where users go
Showingh flows separate lets you focus, coming helps you compare
Style doesn't matter as much as content

# UX Design Patterns

## What are design patterns?
Visual strategies for solving common usability problems
Keeps cognitive load (the mental effort involved in decision making) to a minimum
Making your design too new and users won't understand
Users spend most of their time on other sites, so yours should work similarly
(Stop signs in other countries, for example)
Not intended to create identical experiences
Provide common language of familiar terms

## Psychology of design patterns
Users form first impressions in 50 ms: what it's about, how to navigate, whether to trust
Why?
### System 1 thinking
(automatic, instinctive, emotional) to determine how I search, browse, etc.
If this is positive, quickly scan for interest.
Also known as heuristics: mental shortcuts in problem solving that prefer quick satisfactory solutions over slow optimal ones
Pattern recognition is a popular heuristic
### System 2 thinking (deliberate, logical)
Think about experiences that kept this thinking to a minimum

## Implementing design patterns
Four pre-steps
### 1. Identify problem
ans 2 questions: what does user what to do?
What's preventing them from doing it?
Analytics can provide info on where users bail out

### 2. Define context
Where does problem occur? Can also determine via analytics research

### 3. Find common solution
How have other websites/apps solve this problem?
uxlibrary.org is a helpful resource

### 4. Check out examples 
Where and how is pattern being impliment?

## Beyond design patterns
What happens when can't find existing pattern?
Sketch out designs!
ie. "swipe left or swipe right"? by Tinder
"Innovate when you know you have a better idea, but take advantage of conventions when you don't"
--Steve Krug, "Don't Make Me Think"

# Navigation Patterns
Common set of features for navigating:
1. a header in upper l or top center as home button
2. navigation tabs
3. A way to log in

One thing all 3 have in common: no effort to indicate level of affordance
Affordance: properties that suggest what can be done with an object
ex. hyperlink text
Primary clue for users is placement on page

## Apart from text placement, what rules dictate primary navigation bar?

### Reduce number of options
The time to make a decision increases w/number of options

### Keep important links first to last
Users remember those two most

### Consistent labeling
Should be the same no matter what page I'm on

### Highlight current link
So users know where they are

## In mobile
Tab bar at bottom of the screen
But vary from site to site

# Dropdown and subnavigation
What to do with subnav?
Common: reserve subnav until user clicks a main category
Mega menu: provide group navigation menus all at once (ex. shopping sites)

## Burger icon
Drawbacks:
reduces discoverability
adds interaction costs (user must tap or click)

Pros:
Saves screen real estate
but easier to achieve on sites w/not a massive amount of options

## Breadcrumbs
a list of text links representing current page and hierarchical ancestors
ex. Best Buy > Audio > Headphones > Airpods.
harder to undersatand on mobile

In web terms, navigation is about wayfinding: keeping users aware of urrent location in overall hierarchy of website

## Pagination and Filtering
Making large sets of results approachable, so filters like the ones in Etsy are helpful for making users feel less overwhelmed. However, Etsy does not allow you to filter for wigs between cats and dogs, making for a weaker experience. Allowing more specific filters builds user confidence.

Pagination works best while coupled with pagination options (like number of results per page.)
Sites like Pinteresg give you infinite scrolling to instill sense of discovery. This can be addicting.

Infinite scrolling does not make for information-heavy text where users need to remember information.

## Footers
Users make first impressions in first 50 ms, so designers focus efforts above fold. Users keep unconscious mental notes. No footer feels less professional.
Footers contain additional information that would be of interest to some people, but not most.
Footers are a way to convince uncertain users of the benefits your site offers or direct users to hard-to-find content. Having no footers on a mobile app may make the app better for shopping, but harder for customer service.

## First impressions
Users browse using fast thinking
More time spent scanning than reading
Keep them w/navigation patterns, but it's not enough.
Try to lower bounce rate: the % of users who visit a site and leave w/o taking any action
Aesthetic-Usability Effect: Users often perceive pleasing design as design that is more usable. Creates a positive response
Grid: invisible lines that show where your content aligns

### Visual hierarchy
presenting design element to show order of importance
A good test of this is blurring content and see if most important stands out.
Three ways to adjust this.
1. Scale: largest design elements and boldest types attract most attention
2. Type?
3. Law of Proximity: objects near each other tend to be grouped together
Proximinity helps estab relationsahips with content

## Scanning patterns
studied since 30s, but took off in 90s
F-pattern: users sweep top of page from left to right, then down left side
Users use F-pattern primarily for badly formatted text to minimize effort
Good design can prevent F-shaped scanning
Evolved patterns: Slack's Z-pattern alternates image and text placement

## Layer cake pattern
invites more purposeful eye scanning by emphasizing heading and subheading. only occasionally emphasizes body copy
### Applying layer cake
Most common critique is "That's too much text."
Font size should be 16px bare minimum for comfortable reading on web
Space btw paragraphss ahould be at least twice size of text
One idea per paragraph
Grouping paragraphs w/subheadings lets users spend less effort deciding what to read
Headings should be spaced closer to paragraphs they describe, not equally spaced (floating headings)
Highlight a few key takeaways, but the more you use it, the less effective it is
TLDR (or inverted pyramid): starting w/conclusion

## Dark patterns
interactions designed to trick users into doing something they donâ€™t want to do.
* Trick question: takes advantage of this tendency by presenting text that appears to mean one thing at a glance but means the opposite when read carefully.
* Sneak into Basket: happens when an e-commerce site sneaks an additional product or service into your shopping cart.
* Roach Motel: describes an online situation (such as subscribing to a mailing list) thatâ€™s easy to get into, but hard to escape from.
* Privacy Zuckering: involves tricking people into publicly sharing more personal information than intended.
* Price Comparison Prevention: retailers make it difficult to directly compare the cost of two different items.
* Hidden Costs: unexpected charges reveal themselves at various points in the shopping process
* Misdirection: occurs when websites purposely focus your attention on one place to distract your attention from another. A common example is when websites make an expensive product or service look more visually appealing than a free or reduced-cost option.
* Bait and Switch: Users set out to accomplish one thing, but something opposite and undesirable happens instead.
* Confirmshaming: uses guilt to convince users to opt into something.
* Disguised ads: advertisements designed to look like web content or navigation.
* Forced continuity: when a user supplies payment information for a free trial or service and the supplier hides the â€˜subscription renews automaticallyâ€™ info or makes it difficult to cancel the automatic renewal
* Friend spam: A product asks for permission to access your address book, then sends spam messages to your contacts.
