Curse of knowledge; instead, be empathetic

# Creating User Experiences

## User persona
rep profiles of most common type of user
Individual users behave differently
Assess realistically - the main ppl using your product
Why are they using it?
What are their limitations?

### How to create them?
Docs in course notes will help!
Demographic: cannot control
Psychographic: can control; interests
Name, job, location, age, marital status, gender, needs, character traits, habits, goals

## Empathy maps
a tool for ux designers consider how audience uses app based on circumstances
What are they expecting?
Which competitors will users use?
Think & Feel?
Hear?
See?
Say & Do?
Pains?
Gains?

# Determining Goals for your Product
up to ux designer to help meet needs
must talk to anticipated potential users early and often
why wouldthey buy or use product?
Every choice should support helping user reach goals
Can have multiple goals: give drives jobs, get ppl home safely, want app to be popular

## Combining your goals w/user goals
What do they have in common?
Should be win/win for company/user
Venn diagrams help
Can make qualitative goals quantitative by making goals based on fact, data, and measurable outcomes
Think money, engagement, downloads, etc. KPIs
Look at Google Analytics to see how users interact w/you
"Do table reservations improve when you update site?"

# Planning the user journey
## User flow
the route we want users to take from one part of the product to another
should be as efficient as possible "in as few clicks as possible"
The easier it is to book, the less likely to use a competitor
There are specific steps they should taje to reach goals, so steps should be logical
Not every user flow is the same.
We need to guide users w/butoons, feedback, notifications, etc.
