INTRO
API: Application Programming Interface.
How two apps communicate. Servers only return data, not webpage
APIs allow devs to create apps that mash up data from diff sources
Ex. City API of where dog parks are and Google API for location
JSON and xml are two types of structured data, which does not fit well into table.
structured data is more like a tree w/many branches

DATA TYPES & STRUCTURED DATA
Integers, decimals, text, T/F, dates are all data types.
JSON uses only numbers, strings, and Boolean.
XML only uses strings
Any check boxes is a Boolean

Can have groups of data called Collections. Two common types:
1. Arrays (list of data values) always have
size (how many are in the list)
and an order (which object comes first)
2. Dictionaries (list of data keys and values)
Use key (word) to look up value (definition)

STRUCTURED DATA combines data types and collections (of collections if needed)
API responses are almost always structured data
Requests sometimes have structured data

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) created to hold structured language in JS
Most popular way for web APIs
Uses arrays (in brackets, comma seperated, mixed data types) and
objects (dictionaries) enclosed in curly brackets, keys and values seperated by colon,
pairs seperated by commas, any data types, but string is popular key type

NESTING: objects and arrays inside of one another
Two ways to handle it:
1. Indentation best for no objects used, take up less space;
Table for each object type: best for reused objects; take up more space


DOCUMENTING JSON
Start w/sentence for what it represents.
Then table w/Element (key name), description, type, and notes columns (good template for JSON responses)
Request table is identical except should have a required column
If it IS optional, then there should be a default value in the notes
***If indenting in file, indent in table, too, so Element column has two subcolumns
Making up names for object types is OK.

XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is like html except it holds any kind of structured data.
2 ways of handling data
1. tags: angle bracets on both sides < and />
Tag names must only be letters, numbers, and underscores
Content goes btw tags, which can have other tags (tested data)

2. Attributes
Key/value pairs that are all string and no quote. Only letters, numbers, underscores
Attributes appear in start tag: key="value"
Used to indicate a property of data (metadata)
first line indicates that files is xml, don't need to docu

USE STRUCTURED DATA FOR DOCU
Using structured data means docu is "machine readable"
Can do automated testing or interactive docu
