Technical writers also show software developers the flaws in their product because if you can't describe how to do something, it must not be very intuitive.

Functional documentation explores and describes the object/product; task-oriented (TO) doc'n describes how to do specific tasks. Software technical writing will almost always be TO

Research/collect info>Write information dump>begin to sctructure a draft>present draft to stakeholders and get feedback>reflect feedback>prep final delivery>publish>collect customer feedback

MarkDown - a super simple markup language used by developers.

Major challenge for new tech writers is where to get started in the field.  GitHub is free to use. If you use it, you can send an online portfolio of tech writing work.

24. Why Writing in GitHub?
You can use GH to show you can write software documentation, but knowing the GH wiki is not enough. There are too many restrictions in this.

Without software documentation, you don't really have a software product.

GH Wiki is not preferred for tech writers because it is too simple, but it can be used to show off tech writing skills

When someone buys a product, they buy the company. TWs are the face of the company.

If customers do not find what they're looking for in a matter of seconds, they will go to next provider.

35. How to Use a Style Guide in Technical Writing
On a higher level, style guides also determined by branding, or how the company expresses itself to the world. Also includes name and logo.
The style of your documentation is determined by the product and audience.
When customer buys a product, it buys the whole company. No one seperates the two; tech writers are face of company
If you do not provide the answer in a matter of seconds, people will just go to the next prover
You will likely be writing on a team w/at least 2 writers.
Standard style guide is important to match company brand to style.
Place condition before the statement: "If you want to proceed, click Next."
ALWAYS explain what before how: "To delete text, use backspace."
Use positive formulations: "Enter your name", not "Don't enter your name if you don't want our newsletter."
If no style guide, simply sit down with stakeholders and come up with a few simple rules.
Stick w/simple present tense
Explain what before how and describe actions chronologically.
Always use active voice!
Writing concisely and eliminating unnecessary words are important for technical writers.
Reach out to other roles within co. and confirm style guides work for them, too.
Style guides achieve well-organized content, simplicity, conciseness, and preciseness.
Users tend to read docs on their phones, so tables need to be compatible or not used at all. But depends on the audience.
******One of the biggest rules for newbies is: use bulleted list when order that info is consumed doesn't matter (i.e. just listing functions of a product); use numbered list when the order DOES matter (i.e. steps to parallel parking)
Tables do not work on mobile phones, so need to think about what info they'll contain and how it will be rendered.
Research shows that users are scared of a wall of text in software documentation. Spaces between direction will help users perceive and retain info.
Use positive formulations: always tell user what to do, not what not to do.

Documentation is often legally binding and should therefore be true. A company can be sued d/t incorrect documentation.
'Can' or 'may'. Can stands for something possible for user or system; may is more vague.
Must = requirement
Must not = prohibited
Should = recommended
Should not = not recommended
May = optional; you can choose to do this or not
Do not usd umbrella terms, or one word that means more than one thing.
Do not use umbrella terms that might have different definitions
AVOID: contractions, humor, gender, or jargon


5. Introduction to Structured Writing

Structured and consistent writer =smoother UX. Ideally, the user will only need a few seconds before they understand your logic.
Structured writing allows users an intuitive experience in reading documentation. AGAIN: If a user doesn't find their answer in a matter of seconds, they will give up.
Structured writing also helps the writer: if you need to make any changes to doc, you'll know exactly where to find them.
Software docs must no longer be in a book format because users now want a personalized experience.  Make sure docs provide clear seperation between different audiences or target roles. Devs don't want to read about admin and vice versa.
Avoid book formats because users want a personalized experience: an admin doesn't care about API; a developer doesn't care about admin functions. You MUST provide a clear separation between audiences.
Google recently updated their searches to find answers written in a structured format.
Something to keep in mind: No one WANTS to read software documentation. It's meant to solve problems.

64. Common Information Types
Out of hundreds of information types, the seven most common are: concept, procedure, process, principal, fact, structure, and classification.
Modern tech writing is impossible w/o knowledge of XML (extensive markup language).
If you don't have any tools to work on structured writing, create them.
***If you're looking for something consistent across all industries, look at DITA, or Darwin information type architecture. DITA allows tech writers to base any XML they need to make up on a standardized specification. It's popular globally in software doc. They took into consideration information types and found you only really need three:

CONCEPT: allows you to provide conceptual types of information
TASK: allows you to provide info in sequential steps to follow
REFERENCE: allows you to bundle together different types of info

Depending on industry/company, you may have to create your own information or structure types.
Structured writing is about templates. Need a template for CONCEPT, TASK, and REFERENCE information types.
Microsoft Word is a nightmare for tech writers bc it doesn't handle/transform large volumes of text. ToC and tables can break easily.

In the steps section, you only want to explain the steps to achieve ONE GOAL. If you find yourself documenting more than 10 steps, then it's not a single topic. You need a new one.
Many users skip conceptual information, so it's important to provide an examples section that will give some a concrete understanding of concept.
Developers prefer working on one long document as opposed to several short documents. Choice is yours. In wikis, you can make a unique URL to point to each section of a longer docu.
JIRA is one of the most famous project management softwares out there, which integrates well with wikis like GitHub.

5. Introduction to Structured Writing
Terminology, features, and scope of documentation and different ways to address different parts of software are already discussed in learning to docu a seemingly simple calculator app.

An opportunity for TWs is researching and defining entire architectural constructs of org. Or become a content strategist or an architec if user assistance and software docu.

Hard skills are expected of tech writers, but soft skills will make or break a career.
TW's must be willing to talk to customers: What problems are you facing with the product? Why did you purchase the product? What are they using it to achieve? What environment are they working in? What is the environment in which they consume your software? What are their information needs and preferences?

Questions to ask developers. Likely not part of final docu, but without it, you might have a hard time getting it right
What are they developing?
Why develop this functionality?
Who wants this functionality?
How was it developed?

***Focus on the customer's needs, not the writing. It's a given that I'm a good communicator.
Just describing the user interface (functional TW) is not going to get you very far. Once users familiarize themselves with the software, they will have completely different needs, which you can find out by knowing who your customers are. What devices are they using? Their age?

Audience research includes researching information needs: what they are looking for and preferred method of learning.

Deciding on style will include high level discussions with anyone directly involved in company branding. Be aligned in all areas so customer sees one voice for one company. The TW must facilitate these discussions and apply this style to all parts of product.

6. The 12 Principles of Technical Writing
77. Principle #4: Decide Which Deliverables to Create
Will need a quick start guide, a getting started guide, tutorials for newly onboarded, then guides for more advanced users. In agile world, planning/scheduling is most essential skill. NEED to have a clear plan with a backlog (most likely in JIRA), it will be clear what you are working on, what deliverables team can expect and in what order.

6. The 12 Principles of Technical Writing
77. Principle #4: Decide Which Deliverables to Create
One software =/= just one guide. You'll identify many target audiences, all of whom require their own guide.

0:31
6. The 12 Principles of Technical Writing
77. Principle #4: Decide Which Deliverables to Create
One software does not always mean just one guide. Not so.

Knowing your target audience will determine this: you might need a guide for admins, devs, etc. You also need a QuickStart guide, a getting started guide, a set of tutorials for newbs, specific guides for advanced users. All must be separate deliverables.

(When using Agile, it's important to have something to use ASAP, so planning and communication arre super important.)

Typical plan: write functional guide, followed by getting started guide, then move to other deliverables. Best to have a plan outlined in a task management software.

85. Principle #12: Repeat!
Publishing docu is only one step. Then, you enter into maintenance and update phase.

In this phase, check with support staff. Are they receiving new questions? Less/more tickets? Are some topics read more than others? If so, why? Do you need to update a topic no one reads?

94. Understanding DITA: Authoring Point of View
In DITA, the content is separated from the deliverable structure and organization and may look completely different between production and final product. Deliverables are organized using DITA maps; the content is written inside your topics.

DITA has specific writing rules that must be followed and your content must be written in a way that allows for content to be broken down into modules or reused.

Write CONTEXT-FREE. Never assume that the next paragraph will be there in the final product.

7. Software Documentation Development using DITA XML in Oxygen Author
95. Understanding DITA: Information Architect Point of View
Reusing content in DITA can happen everywhere. Think about a prerequisite paragraph that is used over and over again for other tasks.

DITA allows specific linking strategies that auto-assigns links to different content.

DITA can find broken links for you.

Filtering and flagging certain information can help you hide info to create a more personalized experience for a user based on certain conditions.

DITA allows you to control metadata and construct taxonomies for constructing controlled vocabularies.

106. When to Use Graphics in Software Documentation?
You should aim to be visual as often as possible. But not all the time is appropriate.

Usually, if you have to explain software architecture and it's relationships btw parts of your software landscape. Or if you have to explain a complicated process that is not just 3-4 steps.

The more complex, the more you should consider a graphic.

0:19
8. Using Graphics and Images in Software Documentation
108. Process Graphics
2 types of graphics:

Process graphics: goes through a set of steps to get an expected results. Invaluable to get full picture of the process and to know when I need to do what and what happens on the back end.

Architecture graphics: when there are multiple players in your software landscape.

For example, a GitHub repository includes Git where you store content; a separate module for project management; a wiki page for docu; etc.

Make two diagrams: one for what the architecture is; and one for the processes for each part of the landscape, and the order of each process.

RULES FOR GRAPHICS IN TW

Always explain what's in the graphic using text. Graphics do not take away the need for the written part.

Adhere to rules of accessibility

Include alt text for screen readers

Be mindful of colors that affect people with color blindness.

Use consistent colors and styles across docu

Always keep original source of imagine or graphic so it is always translation-ready.

Use a small graphics repository for two things: source files from which you produced graphics; and the graphics themselves. Use the source files for translations and use graphics for in docu itself.

117. Demo: Using Microsoft PowerPoint
SmartArt button in header in Powerpoint. Want to typically use graphics that go top to bottom, unless you know they will be using a large screen -- then you can use a bigger graphic.

Visuals guide text, not the opposite, so stay away from large blocks of text in graphics.

Use Quick Styles button to play with color scheme. (Or right-click to Styles) Go for multiple colors: people's minds better remember your graphic if they associate it with different colors.

Saving file as a png or something saves the entire slide with large margins, so using a snipping tool usually works better.
