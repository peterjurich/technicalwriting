# What is Python?
A dynamic, interpreted language
No declarations of variables, etc. source code makes it short and flexible
No need to remember syntax.
## Why use it?
Readable, easy to learn, free, cross platform, open source, large standard library
## What can it do?
Create web apps, use along software workflows, big data and complex math, rapid prototyping and production ready software dev.
## Need for Python?
Can work on many platforms, easy syntax for beginners, code can be executed as soon as its written (interpreted system) so prototyping is quick
Can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way, or a functional way
## How different?
Designed for readability
Uses new lines to complete a command
Relies on indentation and white space
# Basic Syntax
Data input/output, basic syntax, practical examples
## Indentation
Code usually written in blocks. Indentation helps define blocks
Non-indented code is start of the block. Subsequent must be indented by one level.
### Rules for indenting
Do not indent first line of code.
The way you indent the second line must be the same way you indent subsequent lines.
It is best to use 1 tab or 4 white spaces
To indent automatically, use a colon
For example
if 5>2:
    print ("Yes, five is greater than two")
print("No, five is not greater than two")

# Comments
Explain the code to make it more readable.
Also prevents execution of test code.
Create comments by using pound sign (#) at the beginning, if single line of code
Alternatively, use """ at the beginning and end of an entire block.
Can put comments at the end of a line of code, too.
For example: print ("Hello world") #This is a printing code

# Variables
Act as a container for data values

## Rules for naming variables
Must start with letter or underscore.
CANNOT start with a number
Names are case sensative

You can give variables in the same line
For example: x, y, z = "A", "B", "C"
Can print as:
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
or print (x, y, z)

### Multi-word names
Camel case: Each word except the first is capitalized
myVariableName

Pascal Case: Every word capitalized
MyVariableName

Snake Case: each word seperated by an underscore
my_variable_name
