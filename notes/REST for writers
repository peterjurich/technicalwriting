REST (REpresentational State Transfer) method for client devices and services to pass data back and forth
A category of web APIs, or how softwares communicate over web.
Most popular
Request: "Please send me the state of my feed"
Response: "I am sending you data that represents the state of your feed."

REST
Is a Design pattern (a set of guidelines) not protocol (which must match exactly (like a USB)
"RESTful API" is common term
REST uses HTTP same protocol that web addreses use
Resource is a piece of data that reps something (username, ex.)
REST is independent of format; JSON is popular
It is stateless, state of device not stored on server: up to browser to keep track of math, not the server

SOAP (Simple Object Action Protocol)
Previously most common web API, not simple
Only supports xml.
It is a protocol, not a design pattern, so advantages and disadvantages

REST REQUESTS
Method: actions you take by making a request. GET, POST, DELETE, are examples

QUERY PARAMETERS
