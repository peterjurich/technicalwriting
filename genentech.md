Here is a list of daily accomplishments at Genentech:

## April 21, 2023
Throughout this week, I accomplished a variety of tasks that contributed to the success of our projects. One of the tasks I completed was creating a release email template, which will allow us to easily send out important updates and information to our stakeholders. Additionally, I ran Monica's transcript through ChatGPT and created a zap for completed Genentech tasks, which will streamline our workflow and help us work more efficiently.

Another significant achievement this week was meeting with Jim Fairman for the first time about the TaPIR project. This meeting helped us establish clear goals and objectives for the project, and I began drafting a plan to move forward. I also had a TaPIR comms discussion, which allowed us to align our communication strategy across all stakeholders.

In addition to project-specific tasks, I also completed some training and professional development activities. I attended a Social Media training session and a Compliance Fitness Fundamentals training, which helped me stay up-to-date on industry best practices and regulations. I also spent time in the course AI for Everyone and watched the Career Development Roadshow, which will help me grow my skills and knowledge.

Overall, this week was productive and successful. I worked on a range of projects, from creating templates to drafting communication plans, and completed various training activities. These accomplishments will help us achieve our goals and continue to grow and improve as a team.

This week, I completed a Lucidchart course on creating basic diagrams and learned how to use the software to create a human sample tissue tree. I also reached out to Vivek and Fiandalo regarding inconsistencies in TQ flow versions and had a working session on comms and templates. Additionally, I reviewed Sharon's template and built a Lucidchart on CTG45 workflow. 

In terms of communication, I wrote a reflection on my newsletter experience and data and took a stab at a publication timeline for the newsletter. I also worked on the header for outage reports and iterated the outage announcement banner. Furthermore, I created an agenda message template and began drafting a Slides template for Data Concierge.

Lastly, I attended a talk by Dr. Cheryl Holder on health and climate and completed a Lucidchart course on collaborating on diagrams and conveying diagrams effectively. I also attempted to finish ordered steps for rare variant TQ workflow in Germline and learned about the future of chemistry and language.

Overall, this week was filled with a variety of tasks related to communication, software usage, and project development. I worked on improving templates and workflows, collaborated with colleagues, and learned new skills through online courses and external events.

## May 4, 2023

Last week, my work was quite diverse and involved a range of tasks. I began by developing and sending a meeting agenda to Madalene in preparation for an upcoming discussion. I also scheduled a Q2 newsletter planning meeting with relevant stakeholders and conducted a Data Concierge check-in to review progress and address any concerns. Attending a BizOps meeting was another item on my to-do list to discuss current business objectives and strategies. I had to reschedule a meeting with Vivek due to an all-day training conflict but made sure to translate a Slack conversation with Madalene into actionable tasks for project execution. Additionally, I conducted research on training needs assessments to better understand requirements and delved deeper into the Data Concierge folder to enhance understanding of the project scope and goals.

To maintain consistency, I aligned the CTG45 process with Madalene's Informatics Systems training document. I analyzed common trends among various presentation decks to identify areas for improvement and reviewed existing CSTAR presentation decks for potential updates and revisions. I even created a streamlined CSTAR master deck outline, reducing its length by 48% while maintaining its key content. As part of the creative process, I designed a banner for product release notes to enhance visual appeal and collaborated with Sharon to edit product release email templates for clarity and effectiveness. I also redesigned a banner for release notes to better align with branding guidelines.

Finally, I attended a surprise meeting with Tracy to discuss urgent matters and conducted a one-on-one meeting with her to discuss progress, challenges, and upcoming priorities. It was a busy but fulfilling week, and I am excited to see what the next week has in store.
