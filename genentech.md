## May 4, 2023

Last week, my work was quite diverse and involved a range of tasks. I began by developing and sending a meeting agenda to Madalene in preparation for an upcoming discussion. I also scheduled a Q2 newsletter planning meeting with relevant stakeholders and conducted a Data Concierge check-in to review progress and address any concerns. Attending a BizOps meeting was another item on my to-do list to discuss current business objectives and strategies. I had to reschedule a meeting with Vivek due to an all-day training conflict but made sure to translate a Slack conversation with Madalene into actionable tasks for project execution. Additionally, I conducted research on training needs assessments to better understand requirements and delved deeper into the Data Concierge folder to enhance understanding of the project scope and goals.

To maintain consistency, I aligned the CTG45 process with Madalene's Informatics Systems training document. I analyzed common trends among various presentation decks to identify areas for improvement and reviewed existing CSTAR presentation decks for potential updates and revisions. I even created a streamlined CSTAR master deck outline, reducing its length by 48% while maintaining its key content. As part of the creative process, I designed a banner for product release notes to enhance visual appeal and collaborated with Sharon to edit product release email templates for clarity and effectiveness. I also redesigned a banner for release notes to better align with branding guidelines.

Finally, I attended a surprise meeting with Tracy to discuss urgent matters and conducted a one-on-one meeting with her to discuss progress, challenges, and upcoming priorities. It was a busy but fulfilling week, and I am excited to see what the next week has in store.
